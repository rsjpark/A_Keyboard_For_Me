# A Keyboard For Me is a project designed to learn about the processes of making/designing a keyboard from the ground up in order to build a tool that is fully customized for me

# It allows me to tailor the shape of the keyboard for ergonomics as well as the firmware for workflow efficiency and ergonomics (having every key be near home row and not having to reach out more than 2 keys)

# I will tackle the challenges of designing/creating a case, pcb, plate, and firmware. Parts such as stabilizers, switches, keycaps, and other mechanical parts will be bought.
